# Developer Hangout - Coding Challenge
## May 2018

## E-Commerce Front-End

## Description:

In this Coding Challenge, you must create a Front End e-commerce website for the fictitous company "DevHosts".

DevHosts is a VPS and cloud computing platform. They are comparable to Digital Ocean, Linode and Vultr.

The site will need to handle:


1. User Account Creation
2. User Account Login/Logout
3. Order Tracking (Shopping Cart)
4. Dashboard/Profile page for existing users (can view previous orders, current VPS)
4. Authentication (unregistered users can't view dashboard)

The site will also require:

1. Landing Page with the focus of getting new customers
2. Pages dedicated to explaining what the company offers (ie: product descriptions, view plans & pricing)


## Notes:

This project will hopefully expose you to 'User Authentication' and persisting and manipulating complex objects (shopping cart).

## Which tools, Libraries, Frameworks can you use?

There is no limitation on which tools you use to make this site. You can use vanilla JavaScript, React, Angular, basically anything that you are comfortable using.

## Final Product:

The final product will need to be fully deployed and functional. You must also incude a github repo with your submission.

## Tips:

You can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to deploy your site.

If you need inspiration, always check out the competition. Look at competing VPS companies and try to figure out how and why they designed their website.
