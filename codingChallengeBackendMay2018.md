# Developer Hangout - Coding Challenge

## May 2018

## E-Commerce Back-End

## Description:

In this Coding Challenge, you must create a Back End e-commerce website for the fictitious company "DevHosts", a VPS and cloud computing platform. They are comparable to Digital Ocean, Linode, Vultr.

The backend will need to be capable of:

1. User Account CRUD features (create, read, update, delete)
2. User Authentication
3. Tracking User orders & shopping cart


# Rules:

1. You are allowed to use any framework or library but your code must be original
2. Submissions must include a GitHub repo AND deployed to Heroku
3. Your Github repo must contain a README.md file containing ONLY:

```

<Your Discord Username>
<List of external files used (Libraries, Frameworks)
```
4. Proper use of git required. Keep a maintained commit history (Don't commit everything at the end)

All of these rules must be followed or you will be disqualified. If you need a reference on how to use git, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc&t=445s)

## Notes

This project will hopefully expose you to REST API methodologies, User authentication, how to properly store and handle user data and manipulating and sending complex objets.
